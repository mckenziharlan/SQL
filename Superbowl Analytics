SELECT MAX (Winner_Pts) 
FROM superbowls;

--what are the average points to win a superbowl?

SELECT AVG (Winner_Pts) 
FROM superbowls;

--what are the average points of each team that went to the superbowl?

SELECT Winner, AVG(Winner_Pts) 
AS Avg_Pts 
FROM superbowls 
GROUP BY Winner 
HAVING "Avg_Pts" > 30;

--what teams have above or below average points at the superbowl?

SELECT Winner, Winner_Pts,
CASE
WHEN Winner_Pts >30 THEN "Above Average"
WHEN Winner_Pts <30 THEN "Below Average"
Else "Average"
END AS "Pts_ranking"
FROM superbowls
GROUP BY Winner;
